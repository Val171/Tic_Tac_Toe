# Tic_Tac_Toe
A basic 2 player tic tac toe game using python.

I haven't added an autochecking mecchanism. The win/loss mechanism is quite self explanatory and trivial. Hence it is left to the players to gauge a win/loss.

By default player1 plays as the "cross"(❌) and player2 as "circle"(🟢)
Boxes can be filled by following the grid pattern and entering coordinates of a square as (y,x)
Once all possible moves are played and the game is over (based on player judgement), inputting "R" as "player2" will reset the board and play continues as normal.
